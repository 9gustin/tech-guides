### Tech Kickoff

1. Create a new folder in this repository with the name of the technology.
2. Create a `README.md` in the folder which must have the sections mentioned [here](../../README.md#repository-structure).
    Remember to add all information that may be useful. That may include: style guides, conventions, standards, architecture used, tutorials or documentation on dependencies, tutorial or documentation on programming languages, scripts or tools for development, among others.
3. Add tech to [overall README](../../README.md).
4. Any other resource document created should be inside a `docs` folder.
5. Any subsection you may need should have its own `README.md`.


**Remember** to always keep this information updated, which is why we recommend
creating the documents inside the repository rather than linking, when it's possible.
