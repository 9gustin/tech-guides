# React project folder structure

## Foundation

- Separate responsabilities.
- Easily find code related to each specific view.
- recognize which code is being reused and where.
- avoid `God folders` (a folder that has a lot of files/folders as direct childs).
- Make it easier to predict not only where specific js code is but also styles, templates, internationalization and test files.
- promote component reutilization 
Promover la reutilizaci√≥n de componentes en otros proyectos.
