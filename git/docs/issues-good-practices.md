# Wolox Good Practices for Github Issues

If your project is **open-sourced**, the project should have an issue template
(`issue_template.md`) in `docs` folder. Check [this](https://help.github.com/articles/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository/) for more information.

You can use [this example template](./issue_template.md) as a base and modify it as required.
